- Display (old) images with their corresponding calibration

- Give a warning when detecting large continuous areas of zeros (or any other value continuously present). Maybe a mask is required.

- notify user that "reintegrate" did not actually work on some files

- sum 2d images to TIF instrad of MAT

- make "reintegrate" automatically detect original image and use it when "fsi" is loaded
